## Code Challenge

We have already prepared a sample application for your code challenge.

- Our code challenge does NOT expect you to start from scratch.
- The application has been deliberately broken and actually contains "bad" code; code that we would not accept within Degreed.
- The challenge should take you 3-4 hours to fix... maybe longer if you want to do our **extras**!

This should be fun for you.
We want you to succeed and show us what you can do!
